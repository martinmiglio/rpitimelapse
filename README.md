# RPiTimeLapse

## A timelapse capture and viewing module for Raspberry Pi.

RPiTimeLapse is a collection of services handling the capture, rendering and display of timelapses. The capture service relies on Raspberry Pi's python camera library. A Flask web server hosts a user interface to slect the time period and then display a timelapse. The timelapse is rendered using a multithreaded opencv2 to ffmpeg pipeline to create a web-ready mp4 from the collected images.

## Installation

RPiTimeLapse can be installed on a Raspberry Pi loaded with Raspbian.
Tested on a Pi 3 and Zero W
